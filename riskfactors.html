            <div class="risk-description">
                The Company operates in the <strong>Agri-tech and Information Technology sectors</strong>, which are subject to oversight by multiple regulatory authorities in India (including but not limited to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and relevant data protection authorities). Evolving regulations, changes in interpretation, or delays in obtaining necessary statutory approvals, licenses, and renewals could increase compliance costs, restrict operations, and adversely affect business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the final form, timing, or impact of proposed legislation or regulations.

                Proposed or new laws governing data privacy (including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023), e-commerce, agricultural marketing, software taxation, or intellectual property could necessitate significant changes to the Company's business model, technology architecture, data handling practices, and contractual terms. Compliance with such new frameworks may require substantial capital expenditure and ongoing operational costs, potentially impacting profitability.

            <div class="risk-description">
                The Company faces intense competition from established IT service providers, other Agri-tech startups, agricultural input companies with digital initiatives, and government-sponsored agricultural extension programs. Certain competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and human resources, stronger brand recognition, more extensive intellectual property portfolios, and deeper relationships with potential clients, farmers, and channel partners.

            <div class="risk-description">
                The Company's success is contingent upon the adoption of its technology solutions (including software platforms, mobile applications, and IoT devices) by farmers, farmer-producer organizations (FPOs), agricultural cooperatives, and institutional buyers. Failure to accurately anticipate market needs, demonstrate clear economic value or return on investment, overcome resistance to technology adoption in rural areas, or effectively differentiate from competing solutions could limit user acquisition, engagement, and revenue generation.

            <div class="risk-description">
                <span class="highlight">The competitive landscape includes the risk of competitors engaging in aggressive or unethical tactics.</span> This may include attempted theft of trade secrets, proprietary algorithms, business strategies, or confidential client data through cyber means or social engineering. <span class="highlight">Additionally, targeted recruitment of key technical and managerial personnel to gain access to confidential information, or the filing of strategic, baseless legal claims to disrupt operations and consume management resources, poses a material risk.</span> Defending against such actions requires significant financial resources and management attention.

            <div class="risk-item-title">Dependence on Key Personnel and Talent Retention</div>
            <div class="risk-description">
                The Company's performance is highly dependent on its founder(s), senior management, software developers, data scientists, and agronomy experts. The inability to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain qualified personnel with specialized experience in both agriculture and technology could impair innovation, product development, customer support, and business continuity. The loss of services of one or more key personnel could adversely affect operations.

                The Company's strategy may include diversification into new business verticals (e.g., precision farming services, agricultural fintech, supply chain logistics) or the introduction of new products/services. Such initiatives carry inherent risks of market failure, operational overreach, integration challenges, capital misallocation, and distraction from core operations, which may not yield expected returns and could adversely affect financial performance.

                The Company's platform is vulnerable to service disruptions, software defects, hardware failures, cybersecurity breaches (including ransomware, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks), and rapid technological obsolescence. A significant security incident involving farmer data, financial information, or proprietary business intelligence could severely damage the Company's reputation, lead to legal liability, regulatory penalties, and loss of customer trust. The Company's insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all potential losses from such events.

                India is susceptible to monsoon variability, droughts, floods, cyclones, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Such events can directly disrupt the agricultural ecosystem the Company serves (affecting its client base) and indirectly affect operations through damage to physical infrastructure (e.g., offices, data centers), communication networks, and transportation systems, potentially leading to operational downtime.

Tax assessments or investigations, even if successfully defended, consume management time and financial resources.

                If and when listed, the market price of the Equity Shares may be highly volatile and could fluctuate significantly due to factors beyond the Company's control, including but not limited to:
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Variations in the Company's quarterly or annual operating results from market expectations;</li>

                As noted in Part A, the Company may issue additional equity shares, options, warrants, or other convertible instruments in the future to raise capital, fund acquisitions, or incentivize employees.

                If listed, the Equity Shares may be subject to exchange-mandated restrictions on daily price movements (e.g., circuit filters).
